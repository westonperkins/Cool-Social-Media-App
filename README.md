### User Stories

### Unsolved Problems

- passport setup in a more realistic way.. able to check if(loggedIn == true) then you are able to edit things youve posted. Else, you cannot edit and only view/like/flag

- multer decoder set up better so that youre able to upload movies/videos. Also ideally it would deal with large files in a better way. 

- Error messages handled better in general




---

### Future Advances 

- able to take selfies and add them internally through the application 

- make the overall database more robust so that it can handle a lot of users and a lot of posts all containing potentailly large files

- MORE mobile friendly, maybe so crazy and learn swift and make it a legitimate app

- comments for other users **big one**

- integrate email and specific **User Profiles**

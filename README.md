### User Stories 

The user should be able to create an account which will allow them to view the feed, post within it, edit, like, and flag. Ideally the user should only be able to edit content that they have posted and



---

### Unsolved Problems

- passport setup in a more realistic way.. able to check if(loggedIn == true) then you are able to edit things youve posted. Else, you cannot edit and only view/like/flag

- multer decoder set up better so that youre able to upload movies/videos. Also ideally it would deal with large files in a better way. 

- Error messages handled better in general

- Make the ability to like and flag less clunky


---

### Future Advances 

- able to take selfies and add them internally through the application 

- make the overall database more robust so that it can handle a lot of users and a lot of posts all containing potentailly large files

- MORE mobile friendly, maybe so crazy and learn swift and make it a legitimate app

- comments for other users **big one**

- integrate email and specific **User Profiles**
